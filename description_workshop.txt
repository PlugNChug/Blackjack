[h1]Blackjack in Terraria[/h1]
[h2]Version: {ModVersion}[/h2]
A custom UI that allows you to gamble in-game items.
It comes with an interactable item slot to place bets, animated cards, and action buttons!

Craft a Giant Blackjack Chip with 20 clay and a black dye to access the Blackjack UI.
[list]
[*] Coins
[*] Metal Bars
[*] Sand Blocks
[*] Blinkroot
[*] Lihzahrd Altars
[*] Terra Toilets
[*] and much, much more!
[/list]

Note that this is a simplified version of Blackjack. No support for splitting, doubling down, insurance, or surrendering.
The dealer hits on soft 17.
Your bet items are doubled when you win, multiplied by 2.5x when you get a Blackjack, and deleted when you lose.

This mod comes with configuration options to change the UI and card scaling.

[h2]DISCLAIMER[/h2]
Just like in real life, in the long run, the house will alway win in this mod!
In other words, on average, you are more likely to LOSE than to win.
This mod is made purely for the purpose of fun and entertainment, and we discourage gambling with real money.
